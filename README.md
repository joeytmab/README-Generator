<h1 align="center">README.md Generator (featuring Node.JS)</h1>

## Description

This app exclusively features Node.JS, allowing the user to create a README file for his or her repository.

The user is tasked with answering a series of questions, including the title of the project, a description, utility, and installation and/or test parameters, if any. In addition, several of the more popular licenses are available, in conjunction with their corresponding badges and their designated expansions.

Options to input both a Github account username and an email address also allow users of the app to reach the the creator with additional questions. This, and all other aspects of the generated README, are populated from a markdown and listed sequentially in a table of contents, allowing convenience and maintaining a professional appearance.

Finally, once the README has been generated, the user can pull the created file out of the "output" folder directory for immediate use.

## Installation Parameters

`npm init` and `npm install inquirer` are necessary for proper function of the app. No test parameters are necessary.

Once completed, run the command `node index.js` to open the question prompts and begin creation of the README file.
